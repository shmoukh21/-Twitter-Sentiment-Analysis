# Sentiment Analysis with Tweets

## Objective
The aim of this project is to design and implement supervised machine learning models for sentiment analysis using tweets. The goal is to classify tweets as positive or negative using Python, leveraging a dataset of 1.6 million tweets to train three different models.

## Description
This project involves analyzing the sentiment of tweets using supervised machine learning techniques. By utilizing a large dataset of 1.6 million tweets, we train and evaluate three different models to classify the sentiment of tweets into positive and negative categories.

### Models Used
1. **Supervised Learning Classification**: A general supervised learning classifier trained on the dataset.
2. **Logistic Regression**: A logistic regression model trained to classify tweet sentiments.
3. **Naive Bayes**: A Naive Bayes classifier used for sentiment analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 1.6 million tweets labeled as positive or negative. The data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to evaluate the models.

## Technologies
- **Python**: The programming language used for implementation.
- **Scikit-learn**: Used for building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NLTK**: For natural language processing tasks.

## Models and Techniques
### Supervised Learning Classification
A general supervised learning approach to classify tweet sentiments.

### Logistic Regression
A logistic regression model that predicts the probability of a tweet being positive or negative.

### Naive Bayes
A Naive Bayes classifier that uses probabilistic methods for sentiment classification.
